# 2D-Platformer-Player

A 2D platformer player controller I made for myself.
Its not very complicated, The only features are jumping and movement very smoothly and 
I'll keep adding new stuff to it as my game progresses.

# Requirements

1. Layer Ground Applied to all ground objects
2. Rigidbody attached to player with gravity high (I prefer 8)
3. A physics 2D object with no friction applied to the player
4. Colliders
5. A sprite rendere component
6. Jump Button Setup in Input Manager
7. An empty Gameobject for feetPosition

Thats it, Enjoy!
